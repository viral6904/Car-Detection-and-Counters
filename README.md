# 🚗 Car Detection and Counter

This Python project detects and counts cars in video streams or from video files using computer vision techniques. It uses OpenCV along with a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, Haar cascades, or MobileNet-SSD).

## 📸 Features

- Real-time car detection from webcam or video file.
- Car counting as they pass a defined line.
- Visual output with bounding boxes and live count.
- Easy to configure and customize.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Optional (for YOLO or deep learning-based detection):
- `opencv-contrib-python`
- `imutils`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
